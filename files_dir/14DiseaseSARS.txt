Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin that surfaced in the early 2000s caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), the first-identified strain of the SARS coronavirus species severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). The syndrome caused 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. In late 2017, Chinese scientists traced the virus through the intermediary of civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Yunnan province. No cases of the first SARS-CoV have been reported worldwide since 2004. 
In 2019, a related virus strain, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was discovered. This new strain causes COVID-19, a disease which brought about the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. 
SARS-CoV may be suspected in a patient who has:
•	Any of the symptoms, including a fever of 38 °C (100 °F) or higher, and
•	Either a history of:
o	Contact (sexual or casual) with someone with a diagnosis of SARS within the last 10 days or
o	Travel to any of the regions identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as areas with recent local transmission of SARS.
For a case to be considered probable, a chest X-ray must be positive for atypical pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome.
The WHO has added the category of "laboratory confirmed SARS" for patients who would otherwise be considered "probable" but who have not yet had a positive chest X-ray changes, but have tested positive for SARS based on one of the approved tests (ELISA, immunofluorescence or PCR). 
The appearance of SARS-CoV in chest X-rays is not always uniform but generally appears as an abnormality with patchy infiltrates.
