
The Meerkat is a small mammal that is part of the mongoose family. Meerkats were made famous with the TV show Meerkat Manor from Animal Planet that followed several Meerkat families in the Kalahari Desert.

Where do Meerkats live?

Meerkats live in the African Kalahari desert in the countries of South Africa and Botswana. They dig large networks of underground tunnels where they stay during the night.

Do Meerkats live in a group?

Yes, they live in large family groups called clans, mobs, or gangs. The number of meerkats in a clan can vary in size. They typically have around 20 members, but sometimes grow to as many as 50 members. The clan works together to help each other out. One or two meerkats will look out for predators while others scavenge for food. If the lookouts spot a predator they will give a warning bark and the rest of the family will quickly escape into the underground burrow.


The Mob's Territory

Each meerkat mob will have a territory which they mark off with their scent. It is usually around four square miles. They won't allow another group or mob of meerkats into their territory and will fight them, if needed.

What do Meerkats eat?

Meerkats are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. They mostly eat insects, but they will also eat lizards, snakes, eggs, and fruit. They can even eat some poisonous prey like scorpions as they are immune to their poison.

Why do they stand up so straight?

Generally the sentry, or lookout, will stand up straight on its hind legs using its tail to balance.

Fun Facts about Meerkats

Predators of the meerkat include snakes, jackals, and birds of prey.
The burrows that they dig are good for protection, but they also help them to keep cool from the hot desert sun.
Their tan and brown fur helps them to blend into the desert and hide from predators such as eagles.
If the group feels threatened by a predator, they will sometimes try mobbing or attacking it in a group.
