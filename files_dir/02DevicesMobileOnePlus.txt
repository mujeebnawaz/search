
Today, during a remote event, OnePlus officially took the wraps off its two newest smartphones, the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro. The hotly anticipated devices introduce some brand new features to the OnePlus ecosystem while also subtly tweaking the aspects people already know and love.


Let’s break down the core information you need to know about the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro!

The OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7T Pro from late last year looked very different from one another. This year, the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro look very much alike, although the Pro is obviously bigger and with better specs.
With the OnePlus 8, the waterdrop notch of the OnePlus 7T is gone, with a left-aligned display cutout instead. The cutout is pretty small at 3.8mm, which is only slightly larger than the display cutouts on the Samsung Galaxy S20 series . The response to the display cutout trend is about as divisive as the response to the notch trend, so you’ll need to decide if this is truly an upgrade.
On the back of the OnePlus 8, you’ll find a triple-lens camera, although not in the circular module we saw on the OnePlus 7T. Instead, the vertically oriented module from the OnePlus 7 Pro makes a return.
As far as the OnePlus 8 Pro goes, the design is pretty much the same as the OnePlus 8. The display is slightly bigger which makes the phone itself larger.

In the US, the OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro will be sold through OnePlus.com and Amazon, with availability from April 29. Pre-orders start today.
The OnePlus 8 will also be carried by T-Mobile and Verizon. On Verizon, customers will actually get a custom version of the OnePlus 8 called the OnePlus 8 5G UW that supports mmWave connectivity.
