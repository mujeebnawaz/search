Today, Apple launched the 2020 iteration of the iPhone SE. The new budget-minded iPhone looks a lot like the iPhones of a few years ago with a Touch ID-based fingerprint sensor on the front and a solitary camera lens on the back. However, it has some significant internal upgrades and a very attractive price: just $399 for the 64GB model.
Obviously, Apple has been planning on releasing the iPhone SE for quite a while now. While it was inevitable that the phone would launch sometime in either March or April this year, the company now has the benefit of launching a budget iPhone at a time when people need it the most. I don’t want to sound crass or unsympathetic, but the COVID-19 pandemic could be a real boon when it comes to the success of this phone.
In other words, this is the right phone at the right time. It delivers all the basic things people want from an iPhone while keeping the price as low as possible at a time when their financial situation is strained. As government stimulus checks start rolling out across the United States, it wouldn’t be hard to imagine a lot of people taking $400 out of their $1,200 checks they receive this week and buying the iPhone SE.
Meanwhile, where is a similar Android phone in the US? We don’t really see one yet, and that gives Apple even more of an advantage.

If Android OEMs want to know what a budget phone needs to be a recommended buy, that’s the list right there. There’s nothing on the Android market that has all that in the US. The Google Pixel 3a is probably the closest, but there’s no wireless charging and certainly no flagship-style processor in that phone. Even the Samsung Galaxy S10e has a price tag too high to compete with this iPhone SE .
