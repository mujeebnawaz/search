Last year’s Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL leaked so much, we didn’t think any phone could leak more than that. We clearly spoke too soon. If you’ve been following the leaks and rumors over the past few months, you’re probably already familiar with Google’s new smartphones, the Google Pixel 4 and Google Pixel 4 XL. The company has finally announced the two smartphones at its Made By Google 2019 event, and we have all the details here.
The new-and-improved Google Assistant is integrated deeply into the Pixel 4’s software, making for much quicker response times. Both new phones have an on-device version of Google’s language models that run in its data centers. DisplayMate has awarded Google an A+ rating and a Best Smartphone Display Award. The displays on the Pixel 4 and 4 XL are 90Hz displays — Google calls them Smooth Displays — and can be toggled between 60 and 90Hz in the settings menu. Displays with higher refresh rates have been growing in popularity lately, and we’re happy to see the new Google phones support the feature.
The Pixel 4 and 4 XL, according to Google, have the fastest face unlock system on any smartphone. This is possible due to Google’s new motion-sensing Soli chip next to the front-facing camera sensor.
Google ditched the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor this year, and is instead including secure face recognition. Plus, considering the fact that the Pixel 3 has horrible battery life, we’re hoping Google does something to make sure Pixel 4 users can make it through a full day without needing to charge midway through the day.
Google is finally jumping on the dual-camera train. Both the Pixel 4 and 4 XL have a rear-facing 12MP Dual Pixel sensor and a 16MP telephoto lens for 2x zoom. This will result in wider-range portrait shots, as there are now two lenses to capture depth information. There’s also a hyperspectral sensor in the rear camera array to help improve image quality.
Live HDR+ is a new feature coming to the Pixel 4 and 4 XL.
