What does the Bactrian camel look like?

The Bactrian camel is most famous for the two large humps on its back. It is a huge camel that can grow to over seven feet tall at the shoulder! It can grow to over eleven feet long and weight over 2000 pounds.

What do they eat?

Bactrian camels are herbivores, meaning they eat plants. They can eat most any type of vegetation including dry, thorny, or bitter plants that other animals may not want to eat.

Where do they live?

They live in the Gobi and Taklamakan deserts in northern central Asia.

Do they travel in packs?

They tend to live in groups of 6 to 20 camels.

What is the deal with their humps?

Camels store fat in their humps. This fat can be converted to water and energy when they haven't had food or water to drink for some time. Once they have used up all the fat in their humps, the humps become thin and floppy.
The energy in their humps, as well as other adaptations that help them to conserve water, allows Bactrian camels to go for months without drinking water.

Ideal Desert Animals

Besides having two large humps to help them go without water, Bactrian camels have other qualities that help them to survive in the desert. They have bushy eyebrows and long eye lashes that help protect their eyes from the sand. Their nostrils can close as well to keep out the sand.

Are they endangered?

Bactrian camels are classified as critically endangered. This means they are on the brink of becoming extinct. It is thought that there are around 600 of the animals living in the wild, but that their population is on a steady decline.
